## Welcome to AI@UNM

AI@UNM is a collaborative student organization at the University of New Mexico bringing together **students, researchers, builders,** and the broader **AI community**. We focus on the technological advancements and the social impact of developing powerful AI.

**Our mission:** Learn how to use AI to promote your own work, embrace its potential, use it responsibly, and understand its limitations.

## What We Do

We operate across three tracks so you can engage with AI in the way that fits you best:

### Projects Track
Build real products with other students. Ship projects you can add to your portfolio, meet potential co-founders, and gain hands-on experience with AI tools and systems.

### Technical and Policy Upskilling Track
Level up your skills through workshops, technical primers, and deep dives into how AI systems are built, scaled, and governed.

### AI Policy Track
Discuss legislation and policy papers in our journal club. Produce blog posts, research papers, and policy proposals on the issues that matter.
