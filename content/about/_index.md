## Who We Are

Building safe AI is a collaborative mission — it requires **policymakers** to set the guardrails, **researchers** to design transparent and interpretable models, and **builders** to launch applications that positively impact the people they serve.

AI@UNM is a student organization at the University of New Mexico dedicated to exploring artificial intelligence through three complementary lenses: **technical development**, **entrepreneurship**, and **governance**. We believe the best way to learn about AI is by doing — through projects, collaboration, and real-world application.

### Our Mission

1. **Build a community at UNM** that enables people to participate in meaningful work
2. **Introduce people to the world of AI** through the lenses of **government**, **business**, and **academia**

## Our Approach: Projects Are Our Medium of Learning

At AI@UNM, we don't just study AI — we build with it, analyze it, and shape policy around it. Members work on projects that span research, product development, and policy analysis:

- Write a **review paper** on GPU export control
- **Apply** existing AI interpretability methods to new models and problems
- **Create** new model architectures
- **Ship** an AI product and pitch it to investors
- **Develop policy proposals** for adoption of AI at UNM or beyond
- **Your idea goes here** — we support member-driven initiatives

Projects bring together people from different tracks, creating interdisciplinary teams that mirror how AI work happens in the real world.

## Three Tracks

We organize our work across three flexible tracks. Members are encouraged to explore across tracks — there's no requirement to stay in one lane, and projects often bring together all three perspectives.

### Technical — *Shrey Poshiya*

The technical track focuses on understanding how AI systems work and building them from the ground up.

- **Understanding foundations of AI** — research skills, create novel AI frameworks
- **Train, Test, and Deploy Models** — prepare for AI Engineer roles
- **Hackathons, Datathons, and Competitions** — from New Mexico to nationwide, in-person and remote

Whether you're interested in research, engineering, or just want to understand the math behind the headlines, this track helps you build those skills.

### Startup — *Younes Slaoui*

The startup track is for those who want to turn AI capabilities into real products and businesses.

- **Ship AI products** and showcase them in your portfolio
- Find **co-founders and collaborators** for your next venture
- **Test startup fit** — learn whether entrepreneurship is your path

From ideation to launch, this track supports members who want to build things people actually use.

### Governance — *Sophia Finale*

The governance track examines the policy, ethical, and societal dimensions of AI systems.

- **Write policy briefs, proposals, blog posts, and research** — prepare for internships, grad school, and creating change
- **Analyze policy and legislation** — explore careers in law, government, and tech policy
- **Attend conferences, workshops, and build networks** — from Albuquerque to NYC, the Bay Area, and DC

If you're interested in how AI should be regulated, deployed responsibly, or integrated into institutions, this track is for you.

## How We Work Together

**Every Wednesday at 5pm — Farris Basement**

Our weekly meetings follow a structured but flexible format designed to minimize work outside the club while maximizing collaboration:

| | |
|---|---|
| **10-20 min** | General news and presentations — club updates, AI news, or member presentations |
| **30 min** | Vertical and interest groups — tracks meet separately to discuss ideas and share work |
| **70-80 min** | Project collaboration — teams work together (optional but encouraged) |

The first hour is core meeting time; the remaining hour-plus is optional project work. This structure lets you go deep on projects without requiring homework between meetings.

Weekly **Luma invites** keep you updated on exact times, locations, and any special events.
