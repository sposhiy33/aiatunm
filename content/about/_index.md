## Who We Are

Building safe AI is a collaborative mission: it requires **policymakers** to set the guardrails, **researchers** to design transparent and interpretable models, and **builders** to launch applications that can positively impact the people they serve.

AI@UNM exists to:

1. **Build a community at UNM** that enables people to participate in meaningful work
2. **Introduce people to the world of AI** through the lenses of **government**, **business**, and **academia**

### Startup — *Younes Slaoui*

## Working in Groups

Projects bring together members from across all three tracks. A single project might have someone on the technical side, someone building the product, and someone writing policy analysis — all collaborating toward a shared outcome.

## Meeting Structure

**Every Wednesday at 5pm — Farris Basement**

Each meeting follows a two-hour format:

1. **General News & Presentations (10-20 min)** — Housekeeping, news, or a short presentation
2. **Vertical/Interest Groups (30 min)** — Each track meets to discuss ideas and share relevant work
3. **Project Collaboration (70-80 min)** — Teams work on their projects together (optional)
