## Our Tracks

We use a matrix structure: our founders serve as specialist leads across three vertical tracks, while members drive their own projects horizontally across the organization.

### Projects Track

**Technical and Product-Focused**

Work on real AI projects with other students. Members brainstorm project ideas, form teams based on shared interests, and build products from start to finish.

- Ship multiple products you can add to your portfolio
- Participate in co-working sessions
- Meet potential co-founders for building a startup
- Gain hands-on experience building with AI tools and systems

### Technical and Policy Upskilling Track

Level up your understanding of AI through structured learning and hands-on workshops.

- **Technical Primers** for people new to AI — covering the mathematical foundations and how AI systems are built and scaled
- **Workshops** on specialized topics like mechanistic interpretability and AI applications in science and business
- Build real skills that make you AI-native

### AI Policy Track

Engage with the governance and ethical dimensions of AI through reading, discussion, and writing.

- **Journal Club** — discuss new legislation, policy papers, and research
- **Writing** — produce blog posts, research papers, and policy proposals published on our [Substack](https://aiatunm.substack.com)
- Gain tangible experience writing about AI topics, preparing you for careers in law, public policy, and governance

## Meeting Structure

**Weekly on Wednesdays, 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM**

Each meeting follows a consistent two-hour format:

1. **General Session (10-20 min)** — Housekeeping, important news, or a short presentation
2. **Vertical Group Collaboration (30 min)** — Each track meets to discuss new papers, share ideas, and present relevant work
3. **Project Collaboration (70-80 min)** — Teams work on their projects together

We use [Luma](https://lu.ma) for meeting agendas and announcements.
